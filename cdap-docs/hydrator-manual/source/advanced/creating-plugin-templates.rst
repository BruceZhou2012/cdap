Advanced Topics: Creating Plugin Templates
==========================================

From within Hydrator Studio, you can create a **plugin template,** a variation
of a plugin that you can configure with particular settings for re-use. 

To create a plugin-template:

- From within Hydrator Studio, hover your mouse over the plugin you would like to use
  for your template, such as the *Stream* source plugin.

- In the on-hover menu that appears, click the "+ Template" button.

- The window that appears will allow you to specify the version of the plugin to use. Once
  you do, the window will expand to allow you to specify the particular properties of that
  plugin.

- The template will require a name that uniquely identifies it. 

- You can lock individual properties of the configuration so that they are not editable
  when the template is used.

- When the plugin template is successfully saved, it will appear in with the other plugins, with
  an additional "T" icon to indicate that it is a template.

- Templates can be either edited or deleted after they are created, using buttons that
  will appear in their on-hover menu.

Once created, you can use the plugin template just as you would any other plugin, with the
advantage that it can be pre-configured with settings that you re-use or require.
