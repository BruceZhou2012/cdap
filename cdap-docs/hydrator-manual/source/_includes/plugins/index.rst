.. rubric:: Exploring Plugin Details

Details on the available plugins and the required properties for sources, transformations
(transforms), sinks and other plugin types can be obtained  and explored using the
:ref:`Artifact HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-artifact>`.


.. rubric:: Third-Party Plugins: Deploying a JDBC Driver

Covers using :ref:`pre-built third-party JARs <cask-hydrator-third-party-plugins>` so that they
are accessible to other plugins and applications.


.. rubric:: Creating Custom Plugins

If these plugins don't meet your requirements, you can :ref:`create a custom
plugin <cask-hydrator-creating-custom-plugins>`.

If you are creating a custom plugin that extends the **existing system artifacts,** its name
should not collide with existing names, for ease-of-use in the CDAP UI and Cask Hydrator Studio.


.. rubric:: Installing Plugins: Packaging, Presentation, and Deployment

To **package, present,** and **deploy** your plugin, see these instructions:

- `Plugin Packaging: <installing#plugin-packaging>`__ packaging in a JAR
- `Plugin Presentation: <installing#plugin-presentation>`__ controlling how your plugin appears in the Hydrator Studio
- `Plugin Deployment: <installing#deploying-a-system-artifact>`__ deploying as either a system or user *artifact*
- `Deployment Verification: <installing#deployment-verification>`__ verifying an artifact was added successfully
